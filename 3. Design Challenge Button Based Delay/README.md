# Deliverables
You will need to upload your code, well documented. You will also need a README for your code (you can replace this README) which will tell the user:
- How does your code work?
- How are the peripherals configured (what modes, what settings)?
- What design considerations did you have to take to account for things like the timer rollover?
- How should the user use your code?

The code works by using the button on pin 2.3 to change the speed of the blinking LED.
